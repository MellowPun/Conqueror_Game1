  - 'Down here you can see the shop menu.

    You can interpet all the symbols.'
  - On the left you see a coins Icon. The number next to it tells you how much gold
    you have left. So use it wisely!
  - Next to the coins is your arsenal of armymen.
  - Throughout your conquest you will be unlocking more units but for now you only
    have the highlighted ones.
  - You can recruit as many units as you want, but putting them too close to eachother
    will cause friendly fire.
  - 'On the right you see a potion icon. This tells you how much health your enemy
    has. '
  - The amount of health equates to how many units you need to get into the enemy
    castle.
  - 'The units always come from the left and go to the right!

'
  - There is no way to "save" the battlefield. This is an active warzone. That's
    all for now!
  - The way to understanding is by experiencing some real battle. Good luck in your
    quest, my CONQUEROR
